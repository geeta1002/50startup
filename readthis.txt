The pandas - library,  is a popular data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
A DataFrame - is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table and is designed to store and organize data in rows and columns. DataFrames are a fundamental data structure for data analysis tasks and provide a convenient way to work with structured data.
Schema -  A schema defines the structure of the data, including the tables, columns, and their data types. It specifies what types of data can be stored in each column (e.g., text, numbers, dates) and how columns relate to each other.
